# MiniAT-TODO
Develop (and at latest, midsemster, begin using internally) a cross-platform command line TODO list tool for software developers and teams.

Utilize different levels of urgency for To do list i.e Red for High urgency, Green for low-level urgency. (feature)

In Addition, To do file hierarchy, must do certain tasks prior to completing other tasks

Remote commit to team To-Do list 

On command, the program will prompt users to enter Date for completion, Level of urgency, one-line description, prior steps, set reminders if needed, add to calendar, notifications, when the task is added (date & time), individual notification for teams

Microsoft To-Do for reference

Store user info in a database for future reference (print back)

Need to preface each thing TODO with the date it was first introduced
